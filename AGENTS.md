# Agent notes

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is shown to players in the changelog dialog (Settings > Changelog), so write it for them: short, plain sentences about what changed for them, not about the code.

- Add an entry for every change a player would notice: new features, changed behaviour, visible fixes, noticeably better performance. Skip refactors, tooling and changes to these notes. Update the entry as a change evolves rather than adding a second one.
- Each `## ` section is one day, titled with the date, for example `## 30 September 2026`. Newest section first. Add entries to today's section, starting it above the others if it isn't there yet.
- Entries are `- ` bullets. The dialog renders `**bold**`, `` `code` `` and `[links](url)`, nothing else.

## UI components

- Every text field is a `TextField` (`src/components/TextField.jsx`), never a bare `<input className="text">`, so all fields share one size and look. Use its `bad` and `compact` props instead of adding size overrides in CSS. Range, file and the small number box in the new jigsaw form are not text fields.

## Database changes

The SQLite database in `data/` is live in production, so schema changes must never break an existing database.

- Every change to the database (new tables, columns, indexes, data fixes) goes in a new migration file in `server/migrations/`, named `NNN-short-description.sql` with the next number, for example `001-add-piece-locks.sql`.
- Migrations run automatically, in order, when the Vite server starts (`npm run dev` or `npm run start`), each exactly once. The applied version is tracked with `PRAGMA user_version` (see `migrate()` in `server/api.js`).
- Do not edit the baseline `CREATE TABLE` statements in `server/api.js`, and never edit or renumber a migration that has already shipped. Fix mistakes with a new migration.
- Write migrations so they work on a database that already holds data: give new `NOT NULL` columns a default, and backfill in the same migration when needed.
